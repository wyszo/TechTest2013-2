Here's list of questions that would normally be asked to Team Leader/Technical Architect/Project Manager/whoever responsible. 

For this assignment I just assumed I should use default SDK constructs whenever possible and go along with 'standard', modern practices. Let me know if you want me to change any of the assumptions. 

My questions: 
- what type of memory management should I use? MRC or ARC? (ARC assumed)
- should I rely on html parsing or is using REST API allowed in this case; what are the api calls? 
- should I use native XML parsing abilities or rather custom XML parsing library? (using NSXMLParser)
- am I allowed to use custom library for network requests or should I use the native one? (using just NSURLConnection and sendAsynchronousRequest:queue:completionHandler: method)
- should I write unit tests for the project? 
- should I write unit tests first (before writing code; TDD)? 
- should I use default or external library (kiwi?) for unit testing? 
- should I also include behavioral testing?
- should the app be targeted for iPhone/iPad/both? 
- should I use storyboards or rather xibs (or maybe layout interface programmatically)?
- should the app store cached data from earlier application launches? (assumed it shouldn't)
